                <p>I've been working with Unity for several years now, so I'm very comfortable
                with the software and all of its quirks. I may not have professional experience
                in the IT or Game Development field, but I am very excited, motivated, and passionate about game development
                and solving the problems that come with it. I can be introduced to the culture, then 
                adapt and adjust very quickly to become accustomed and successful.</p>

                <p>Other than programming and developing video games, I also love to play them! My favorites are
                    cooperative multiplayer, so that I can get a few friends together and work together to solve a puzzle
                    or take care of bandits terrorizing some villagers, or taking things easy and compete in minigame
                    competitions to try to win crowns!</p>
                <p>I also enjoy taking bike rides through the Hawthorne trail in town.</p>
